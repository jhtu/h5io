Make sure to do these things before releasing new versions:
- Run tests
- Run tutorial
- Update release notes
- Change version number

Then package the code using
    python setup.py sdist

Upload the distribution using
    twine upload dist/*

Build the documentation on readthedocs.org

If everything looks ok with the release, create a tag using
    git tag -a vX.X.X

Then push the tags to the main repo using
    git push --tags
